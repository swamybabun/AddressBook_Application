# Explanation and How to run
This is an address book application for maintaining the contacts in file system. The contacts can also be saved to a repository if configured. The application saves the contact information in file system meaning can be saved to one file or single file for each contact.
This is configured from application.properties.

This application can be run in two ways:

1) As a Spring Boot application
2) Console Stand alone application

Each application has their own README file and how to use the application can be read from those files.

The contacts can be saved to one file or multiple files according to the configuration done in application.properties.

The Spring Boot application start would open a swagger page containing the documentation for the controllers.


Thank you.
